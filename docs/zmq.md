# monero-lws ZeroMQ Usage
Monero-lws uses ZeroMQ-RPC to retrieve information from a Monero daemon,
ZeroMQ-SUB to get immediate notifications of blocks and transactions from a
Monero daemon, and ZeroMQ-PUB to notify external applications of payment_id
(web)hooks.

## External "pub" socket
The bind location of the ZMQ-PUB socket is specified with the `--zmq-pub`
option. Users are still required to "subscribe" to topics:
  * `json-full-hooks`: A JSON array of webhook events that have recently
    triggered (identical output as webhook).
  * `msgpack-full-hooks`: A msgpack array of webhook events that have recently
    triggered (identical output as webhook).


### `json-full-hooks`/`msgpack-full-hooks`i
These topics receive PUB messages when a webhook ([`webhook_add`](administration.md)),
event is triggered. If the specified URL is `zmq`, then notifications are only
done over the ZMQ-PUB socket, otherwise the notification is sent over ZMQ-PUB
socket AND the specified URL. Invoking `webhook_add` with a `payment_id` of
zeroes (the field is optional in `webhook_add), will match on all transactions
that lack a payment_id`.

Example of the "raw" output from ZMQ-SUB side:

Notice the `json-full-hooks:` prefix - this is required for the ZMQ PUB/SUB
subscription model. The subscriber requests data from a certain "topic" where
matching is done by string prefixes.

> `index` is a counter used to detect dropped messages.

> The `block` and `id` fields in the above example are NOT present when
`confirmations == 0`.
